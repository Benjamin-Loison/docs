# Networks

By default Nethermind launches with mainnet network configuration but you can sync any of the below networks by adding a command line switch:

```
--config [NETWORK_NAME]
```

Network name can be any of the following

* mainnet
* goerli
* rinkeby
* ropsten
* xdai
* poacore
* energyweb
* volta
* kovan (only fast sync and may fail if pWASM transactions appear)

### Mainnet

This is the main public Ethereum network secured by the ethash PoW algorithm.

```
Nethermind.Runner --config mainnet
```

### GÃ¶rli (goerli)

This is a Clique-PoA based testnet supported by all major clients. It has a 15 seconds delay between blocks that are sealed by Goerli validators.

```
Nethermind.Runner --config goerli
```

### Ropsten

This is a test network secured by ethash PoW algorithm which resembles mainnet most closely but is prone to hashrate-based attacks.

```
Nethermind.Runner --config ropsten
```
